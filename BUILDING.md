# Building and Running Locally

react-context-redux is very simple to setup and start contributing.

Dependencies:

* Node.js
* babel-cli: ^6.26.3 (Global)
* rollup: ^0.62.0 (Global)

Once you have the above installed, you are good to go.

## Installing the required packages.

Make sure to run `npm i` on the root folder of react-context-redux repo.

## Building the package.

Once you have made the changes and ready to build and test, run `npm run build` to build the production artifacts.

While developing you can use `npm run watch`. This will watch the `src` folder and build things whenever a file is saved.
